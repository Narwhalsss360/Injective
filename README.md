# Injective

This python package provides a data structure that derives from `dict`.  
The only extra functionality is access to the inverse dict.

# Issues

- Does *not* ensure injectiveness (one-to-one)
- Non reference key-values

# Use Cases

An `Injective` would be used in the case that you map unique keys, to unique keys.
